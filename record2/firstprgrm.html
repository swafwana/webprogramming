<h1><u><center><b>Cosmic Neighbourhood</b></center></u></h1>
<p>
The term "Cosmic Neighborhood" refers to the solar system as the collection of celestial bodies that orbit our Sun. 
<br>
This phrase emphasizes our unique position within this vast expanse of space, highlighting the interconnectedness of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets that share a gravitational bond with the Sun. It paints a picture of the solar system not just as a set of isolated entities, but as a community of celestial objects that interact with one another, forming a dynamic environment ripe for exploration and discovery. The "Cosmic Neighborhood" invites us to consider the relationships and characteristics of these bodies, as well as their significance in the broader context of the universe.
